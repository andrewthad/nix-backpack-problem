# Problem Using Backpack with Nix

The original problem that motivated this repository has been solved. The
solution is that `cabal configure` does not always work correctly in a
`nix-shell` and that `runhaskell Setup.hs configure` must be used instead.
However, a new problem has arisen, one more heinous than its predecessor.

## New Problem Description

Run the following commands, which results in the error shown afterwards:

```
bash> git clone https://github.com/andrewthad/nix-backpack-problem
bash> nix-build --pure release.nix
... elided for brevity ...

```

Make sure you do not have a `dist` or `dist-newstyle` directory in here since
that confuses `nix-build` and can make it claim that it has successfully built
the project. I am able to successfully build this project, and projects like it,
with `cabal new-build` when I am not using `nix`. I suspect that the problem is
that the different instantiations of the same indefinite module are somehow
clobbering one another.

## Original (Solved) Problem Description

The repository is a minimal example that reproduces an error I encounter when
trying to use `nix` to build a haskell project that has a dependency that
internally uses backpack. Steps to reproduce:

```
bash> git clone https://github.com/andrewthad/nix-backpack-problem
bash> nix-shell --attr env release.nix
nix-shell> cabal configure
Resolving dependencies...
Warning: solver failed to find a solution:

primitive-containers)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the
goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: nix-backpack-problem,
primitive-containers
Trying configure anyway.
Configuring nix-backpack-problem-1.0.0...
```

Interestingly, if I just `nix-build release.nix` instead, everything works fine.

Here's some other relevant background information. The package `primitive-containers`
is not yet on hackage. It's on my github. It depends on a fork of `primitive` that
has features that will be added to the next hackage release of `primitive`. Additionally,
`primitive-containers` uses backpack internally. It builds fine on its own
with `cabal new-build`.
